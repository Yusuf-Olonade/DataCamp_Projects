## Project 1: Investigating Netflix Movies

The goal of this project is to investigate the potential causes of the 
decline in the average duration of Netflix movies over time as our friend 
asserted.

### Methodology
Line plot was used to visualize the trend of the movie duration on an annual 
basis. Further investigation with more data required the use of scatter plots 
to investigate the effect of differences in the genre of entertainment on movie 
duration.

### Key Findings
Movies categorized as Documentaries, Children, and Stand-Up were clustered at 
the bottom right of the plot revealing that their duration was less than 60 mins 
and may be responsible for dragging down the average movie duration.

### Skills Developed
Basic Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and manipulation of data in Pandas.
